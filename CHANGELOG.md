# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Since it is a boilerplate project, there are technically no official (versioned) _releases_. Therefore, the `main` branch should always be stable and usable.

## 2020-11-12

Simplification of the Router URLs configuration (#132)

Router's Endpoint config now requires only a CANONICAL_URL and a STATIC_URL from which it extrapolates the different URI components such as `scheme`, `host` and `port`.

Environment variables changes:

_Added_

- `CANONICAL_URL=`
- `STATIC_URL=`

- `PORT=`
- `FORCE_SSL=`
- `STATIC_URL_SCHEME=`
- `STATIC_URL_HOST=`
- `STATIC_URL_PORT=`

### New Relic instrumentation for Phoenix

The `instrumenters` configuration was deprecated from `Phoenix.Endpoint`, and there is no update in [`new_relix_phoenix`](https://hex.pm/packages/new_relic_phoenix) yet to reflect this change! The instrumenter might not work properly…

> [warn] :instrumenters configuration for ElixirBoilerplateWeb.Endpoint is deprecated and has no effect

## 2020-06-17

- Add MixAudit vulnerability security scanning (#114)

## 2020-05-27

## 2020-05-15

- Refactor router split to avoid “You have instrumented twice in the same plug” New Relic warning (#108)

## 2020-03-26

### Fixed

- `make` targets using `npx` now work properly since we now change the current working directory to `assets` before running them
- The `boilerplate-setup.sh` script now supports PascalCase name with consecutive uppercase letters (eg. `FooBarBBQ` → `foo_bar_bbq`)
- The `boilerplate-setup.sh` script now takes into account deeper hierarchy files and the Github Action CI workflow file
- The `BOILERPLATE_README.fr.md` and `BOILERPLATE_README.md` now list the correct dependencies
