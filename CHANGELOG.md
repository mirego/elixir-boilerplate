# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Since it is a boilerplate project, there are technically no official (versioned) _releases_. Therefore, the `master` branch should always be stable and usable.

## 2020-03-26

### Fixed

- `make` targets using `npx` now work properly since we now change the current working directory to `assets` before running them
- The `boilerplate-setup.sh` script now supports PascalCase name with consecutive uppercase letters (eg. `FooBarBBQ` â†’ `foo_bar_bbq`)
- The `boilerplate-setup.sh` script now takes into account deeper hierarchy files and the Github Action CI workflow file
- The `BOILERPLATE_README.fr.md` and `BOILERPLATE_README.md` now list the correct dependencies
