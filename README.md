- Translations with [Gettext](https://hexdocs.pm/gettext) and [Accent](https://www.accent.reviews) (using a scheduled GitHub Actions [workflow](./.github/workflows/accent.yaml))
- [ExUnit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit) tests, factories using [ExMachina](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_machina) and code coverage using [ExCoveralls](https://hexdocs.pm/excoveralls)
- CORS management with [Corsica](https://github.com/whatyouhide/corsica)
